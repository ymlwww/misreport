# misreport

Git repo for the Transactions on Networking(TON) paper "Stealthy Misreporting Attacks Against Load Balancing". The repo provides the python simulation codes for misreport attacks with MAWI dataset.

Usage:
First, download the pcap file from MAWI https://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/. We provide the crawler python script in the utils folder to automatically download pcap files from some date

Second, run the code separately. The singletrace codes can be run directly. The twotrace codes should be run in two stages. Run the store.py first for the twotrace codes.

If you have any question, please email me: Mingli Yu mxy309@psu.edu

If you want to reuse our code, please add reference to the paper. Thank you.
